			Hello, and welcome to my domain. I will update this site
			periodically, but don't expect it to be fast.
		</p>

		<p>
			Information on my actual software projects will be coming
			eventually.

				<td>Master key. The private material is stored, encrypted, on an air-gapped device. Current expiration policy is <em>two years from the date</em> of update. Note that this may also be used for <em>signing</em>; because of its unusually tight control, consider anything signed with this key to be unusually high-integrity.</td>

				<td>RSA 4096-bit</td>
				<td>Encryption</td>
				<td>My main encryption key. I release this to <em>trusted</em> devices, which presently includes a Yubikey 4 nano. Use this key to communicate with me in confidence. Expiration is no more than <em>one year from the date</em> of update.</td>

				<td>RSA 4096-bit</td>
				<td>Signing</td>
				<td>My main signing key. I release this to <em>trusted</em> devices, as above. Use this key to verify integrity of my messages in the usual case. <em>All</em> of my legitmately-sourced outbound email uses this key by default, and all of my Git projects sign commits with this key by default; note that physical interaction with the Yubikey is required to complete the signing process. Expiration policy is no more than <em>one year from the date</em> of update.</td>

			I keep a fairly strong password rotation of around a dozen
			passwords, alphanumeric and mixed-case, all of which are at least
			10 characters, and almost all of which are at least 20 characters,
			as well as some variants to permute. They are not physically stored
			anywhere, including in any sort of password manager; I have them
			memorized. They are organized into four active tiers (including
			shared secrets, web services, organization credentials, and local
			device credentials), rotated to a new scheme every couple of years.
			The storage password for the Certification PGP key is especially
			controlled, and is not reused.

		<h3>Security Incidents</h3>

		<p class="stat" id="infosecstat">Breach Status: <span class="positive">No known exfiltration of confidential data.</span></p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				I have visited the <a
					href="https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-heritage/museum/">National
					Cryptologic Museum</a> recently. Note that it essentially
				shares a campus with the US National Security Agency. My secure
				elements were sequestered safely on my person and unpowered; I
				took measures to check for tampering with my devices afterward,
				and found no evidence. (The Museum is not bad, by the way, but
				definitely meant for the masses :)
			</li>
			<li>
				I operate a <a href="https://mail.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Mail</a>
				account as my primordial mail account, and as a "trust root"
				for a number of my web services. After <a
				   href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/22/technology/yahoo-data-breach/index.html">various
				   reports</a> of a <a
			   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches">data
			   breach</a>, the password for that account was rotated to a variant on a
			   higher tier. Persons who want to email me are still encouraged to use my PGP
			   key for confidentiality, and verify my applicable PGP signatures.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Authority Accountability and Sousveillance</h3>

		<p class="stat" id="warrantstat">Warrant Canary: <span class="positive">I have not been served an order compelling me to secrecy.</span></p>
		
		<p>Pursuant the above, I have also not been ordered to release any of the confidential data I can access.</p>

		<p>Removal or failure to update the above should be considered evidence to the contrary. Last updated 2018-01-21.</p>
