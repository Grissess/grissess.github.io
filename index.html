			I keep a fairly strong password rotation of around a dozen
			passwords, alphanumeric and mixed-case, all of which are at least
			10 characters, and almost all of which are at least 20 characters,
			as well as some variants to permute. They are not physically stored
			anywhere, including in any sort of password manager; I have them
			memorized. They are organized into four active tiers (including
			shared secrets, web services, organization credentials, and local
			device credentials), rotated to a new scheme every couple of years.
			The storage password for the Certification PGP key is especially
			controlled, and is not reused.

		<p class="stat" id="infosecstat">Breach Status: <span class="positive">No known exfiltration of confidential data.</span></p>

		<ul>
			<li id="efail">
				Earlier today, specifics of the <a
					href="https://efail.de/">EFAIL</a> data exfiltration attack
				were released, which leverage a lack of authenticity and cipher
				malleability to inject HTML exfiltration code that would
				activate when the message (including its confidential parts)
				was decrypted and rendered. As a Thunderbird/Enigmail user, I
				am, in theory, affected; however:
				<ul>
					<li>Due to tracking concerns, I have instructed Thunderbird
						to never load remote resources by default;</li>
					<li>My HSM requires physical interaction to decrypt a
						message, even when Enigmail wishes to eagerly do so as
						soon as I peruse it (since, indeed, no indication of
					the authenticity/confidentiality of the message is
					displayed in the tree view, something I've been looking for
				a solution to for several months now).</li>
				</ul>
				Based on my understanding of the attack, this is a fair, but
				not perfect, mitigation. Anyone wishing to send me an encrypted
				email using the PGP standard should (1) strongly prefer to send
				authenticated messages where possible, and (2) instruct their
				 client to compose text/plain messages by default (as I have also done).
				 The latter does not prevent an, e.g., MITM adversary from wrapping the
				 previous body in an HTML email, and a known weakness in the PGP protocol
				 permits the former to be removed. Thus, the crux of this mitigation relies
				 on Thunderbird never loading remote content, which has a worrisomely-large
				 attack surface and was likely never designed to be a significant security
				 (as opposed to privacy) implement. As recommended by the EFF, I will
				 likely switch over to decrypting messages in a terminal or viewing program
				 with no implementation of HTML, which gives all the more reason to send me
				 text/plain messages. (The encrypted source for these emails can be gotten
				 safely from Thunderbird, albeit annoyingly, by timing out the automatic
				 attempted decryption while not authorizing the HSM. Again, in theory,
				 since <em>any</em> application can ask my HSM for decryption, there is a
				 race condition here, but circumstances can be controlled if need be.)
			</li>
			<li id="ncm">
				I have visited the <a
					href="https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-heritage/museum/">National
					Cryptologic Museum</a> recently. Note that it essentially
				shares a campus with the US National Security Agency. My secure
				elements were sequestered safely on my person and unpowered; I
				took measures to check for tampering with my devices afterward,
				and found no evidence. (The Museum is not bad, by the way, but
				definitely meant for the masses :)
			</li>
			<li id="ymail">
				I operate a <a href="https://mail.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Mail</a>
				account as my primordial mail account, and as a "trust root"
				for a number of my web services. After <a
				   href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/22/technology/yahoo-data-breach/index.html">various
				   reports</a> of a <a
			   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches">data
			   breach</a>, the password for that account was rotated to a variant on a
			   higher tier. Persons who want to email me are still encouraged to use my PGP
			   key for confidentiality, and verify my applicable PGP signatures.

		<p>Pursuant the above, I have also not been ordered to release any of the confidential data I can access.</p>

		<p>Removal or failure to update the above should be considered evidence to the contrary. Last updated 2018-05-15.</p>
